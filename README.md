# ISRA-RNU
 
 ## Aim of the study
 
 The aim of the study is to analyse the current process of building the RNU in Senegal and to measure its effective degree of inclusiveness in relation to vulnerable pastoral populations.
 More specifically, this expertise aims to :
 
 - evaluate the process of RNU and the inclusion of pastoralists;

 - to analyse and compare by sampling the current covarage of the social register with regard to the situation of pastoral populations in defined locations;

 - to make recommendations to decision-makers and partners in the process initiated by the Government of Senegal to extend the RNU to the poorest and most vulnerable pastoral populations.

This understanding of the mission will help answer these key questions in the end:

  1 - Does the targeting process (community identification, socio-economic survey) identify poor pastoralist households in the same way as other poor households? For a given area, does the RNU correctly reflect the proportion of poor pastoral households?
    
      - Comparison of the % exclusion errors in the pastoral population with % exclusion errors (based on PMT) in the non-pastoral population.
      - Comparison of PMT score between RNU and non-RNU pastoralists.
      
  2 - What are the characteristics of pastoral households in the RNU? Do these characteristics meet the indicators of pastoral vulnerability?
  
      - Comparison of socio-demographics variables between RNU and non-RNU pastoralists.
